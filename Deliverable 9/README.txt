The above link is to our teamâ€™s prototype in Figma.
We currently have two versions in Figma: our medium and high fidelity prototypes. Please use the high fidelity prototype.


While most interactions with the app are simulated within Figma, text boxes generally do not have interactions in this prototype that would be present in a final version.
The exception is adding a member to a group by their username, where the autofill interaction is simulated.


When the user launches the app, they will be presented with a login screen, where one can also navigate to creating an account.
User credentials are not inputted or verified.


Some common navigational elements in our app are the bottom navigation bar, the add button, and the back button.
The bottom navigation bar allows users to quickly launch into high-level features.
The add button is in the top right corner of some screens and can be used to begin creating a new entry on the current screen.
The back button is in the top right corner of most screens and can be used to return to the previous screen.


When one gets to the main page, there are multiple ways to begin various actions.
Below are descriptions of how to begin high-level features using the bottom navigation bar, as it is present on most screens.


The Trips page is where one can view previous trips and the payment status of other users. One can also create a new trip from this page.


The Invoices page is where one can see the invoices sent to them, their payment status, and pay an unpaid invoice.


The Groups page is where one views and manages groups they are a member of, as well as create a new group.


The Settings page allows users to manage their account and sign out.
